Parsed, processed, and visualized data from OurWorldinData.org. Covid-19 cases and deaths by country and month in shown in the charts below. In my browser, each chart's legend can be scrolled through to see the line colors of other countries of the world. (These are the static screen shots, so not scrollable here.)  Very interesting to do this project!

Perhaps I should clarify that it is total cases, total deaths displayed in the charts showing the progression over time.
